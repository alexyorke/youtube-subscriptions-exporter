# youtube-subscriptions-exporter
Export your YouTube channel subscriptions to a spreadsheet-like text file.

## How to use

- Go to YouTube.com and sign in (has to be on Firefox.)
- Resize your browser window so that the left-hand menu bar appears (with your subscription listing.) If your screen is too small, the window can go off-screen.
- Paste the contents of `youtube-subscriptions-exporter.js` into the `Developer Console` and press enter.
- Copy the result. Each channel is on a seperate line, with the channel name first and the URL second, tab-delimited.


## FAQ

Q: Should this be a Chrome/Firefox extension?
